== Description ==

The WP Background Tile Plugin for WordPress applies a tiled background image to your blog.  
It is as simple as this:

    * Create a background image
    * Upload it
    * Apply it as the background via the WP Background Tile options page

Applying a repeat pattern to the background of a webpage is easily done using css.However, 
if you're not into writing code, or don't know where to insert the css into your 
wordpress theme, then you will find this plugin much easier. It can also be an easy way of 
testing out lots of background images before deciding on one you are happy with.
